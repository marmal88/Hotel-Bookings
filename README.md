# AIAP11 Assessment

## A. Candidate Information

**Name:** Low Guangwen Daniel

**Email:** dlow017@e.ntu.edu.sg

---

## B. Folder Structure

Overview of the submitted folder and the folder structure



## C. Pipeline and Config

### C.1 Deployment Information

The entire file system was created in a virtual environment using conda, please use the following steps to replicate the virtual environment:

```bash
conda create -n aiap11 python=3.9.0
conda activate aiap11
conda install --file requirements.txt
```

Instructions for executing the pipeline and modifying any parameters.


## D. Pipeline information

Description of logical steps/flow of the pipeline. If you find it useful, please feel free to include suitable visualization aids (eg, flow charts) within the README.

```mermaid


```



## E. EDA Findings

Overview of key findings from the EDA conducted in Task 1 and the choices made in the pipeline based on these findings, particularly any feature engineering. Please keep the
details of the EDA in the `.ipynb`, this section should be a quick summary.

## F. Model Choice

Explanation of your choice of models for each machine learning task.

## G. Evaluation of Model Metrics

Evaluation of the models developed. Any metrics used in the evaluation should also be
explained.


## H. Other Considerations



## Evaluation

1. Appropriate data preprocessing and feature engineering
2. Appropriate use and optimisation of algorithms/models
3. Appropriate explanation for the choice of algorithms/models
4. Appropriate use of evaluation metrics
5. Appropriate explanation for the choice of evaluation metrics
6. Understanding of the different components in the machine learning pipeline

### Penalties
1. Incorrect format for `requirements.txt`
2. `run.sh` fails upon execution
3. Poorly structured `README.md`
4. Disorganised code that fails to make use of functions and/or classes for reusability
5. Machine learning pipeline built using Jupyter Notebooks.
